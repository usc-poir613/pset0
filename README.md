# Challenge 0: Version control using GitHub

The goal of this initial challenge is to make sure you know how to work with GitHub Classroom in order to access, complete, and submit assignments. You will also work through an RMarkdown document with some R code to understand how to compile it.

You will have to submit the challenge using GitHub classroom. Remember that I will evaluate you based on your compiled RMarkdown files (in .html format). You can add your responses in italics so that it's easier to read them.

**Deadline: next week before class time**

1.  Getting familiar with GitHub Classroom Workflow

    - Edit the Markdown document [`information.md`](information.md) to include your own details. Follow the instructions in [`GIT.md`](GIT.md) to commit your changes and push them to GitHub.

2.  Look at [`RMarkdown-practice.Rmd`](RMarkdown-practice.Rmd). Fix the code and compile it into an .html file. Commit and push this change as above.

Congratulations, you are finished!

#### Submitting your challenge answers

__You do not have to and cannot actively submit your assignment!__

How "submission" works in GitHub classroom:

1. Commit the changes in your personal assignment repository and push them to GitHub.
2. The moment the assignment is due, GitHub will take a snapshot of the current state of your personal assignment repository. This snapshot is your submission.

So all you need to do is to make sure that you:

1. Commit your changes before the deadline
2. __Push your local changes to GitHub before the deadline__
